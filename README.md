# Pomodoro Timer ⏲️

## Project Description

The *Pomodoro Timer* is designed to help users stay focused and manage their time effectively by using the Pomodoro technique. This timer features a simple countdown clock along with three functional buttons: *Start* 🚀, *Stop* ⏸️, and *Reset* 🔄.

### Key Features:
- **Start** 🚀: Begins the countdown from 25 minutes.
- **Stop** ⏸️: Pauses the countdown at any time.
- **Reset** 🔄: Resets the timer back to 25 minutes.

### How It Works:
- When the *Start* 🚀 button is pressed, the timer begins counting down from 25 minutes.
- If the user needs to pause the countdown, they can press the *Stop* ⏸️ button. The countdown will stop but can be resumed by pressing *Start* 🚀 again.
- The *Reset* 🔄 button returns the timer back to 25 minutes, ready to start a new session.
- Once the timer reaches zero, an *alert sound* 🔔 will notify the user, indicating the end of the session.

This Pomodoro Timer is an excellent tool for anyone looking to improve their productivity and time management. By focusing on tasks for set intervals (25 minutes) followed by breaks ☕, users can avoid burnout and stay consistently productive.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML** 🏗️: For structuring the layout of the timer.
- **CSS** 🎨: For styling the user interface and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** 💻: To add functionality to the timer, including button event listeners and the countdown logic using the `setInterval` function.
